# clock
A popup clock app to replace Windows' clock in the bottom corner since it was bugging out and not showing.

It's an entire electron app for one of the simplest things I've ever done in Javascript. Yep, it's massive and takes a ton of RAM for something really stupid. Please don't use this for anything useful.
